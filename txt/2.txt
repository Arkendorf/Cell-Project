Cell Membrane

The cell membrane is also called the “lipid bilayer”, since the membrane is composed of two sheets, or layers. The lipid bilayer is a thin, flexible barrier surrounding the cell that helps maintain its shape, and protect the cell from its surroundings.

The cell membrane regulates what enters and leaves the cell, to protect it. The lipid bilayer is selectively permeable, meaning that some substances can pass through while others can’t. For example, water and small particles can pass through the cell membrane, while large molecules like sugar can’t get through without help. In addition, charge particles, known as ions, cannot pass through the cell membrane.
