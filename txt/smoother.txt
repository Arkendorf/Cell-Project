Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum is an internal membrane system where lipids, like fatty acids, and proteins are assembled, for transportation within or out of the cell.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum has no ribosomes, but contains collections of enzymes that perform special tasks like creating membrane lipids and detoxifying drugs.
