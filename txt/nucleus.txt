Nucleus

The nucleus is a large membrane-enclosed structure that contains genetic material in the form of DNA. While the cell just needs DNA for its specific task, every cell’s nucleus contains DNA for every part of the body. For example, a toenail cell has the information to become a tongue cell. In addition to containing information, the nucleus is responsible for controlling many of the cell’s activities. To do this, the nucleus sends out instructions in the form of RNA. DNA cannot leave the nucleus, so the nucleus sends out messenger RNA with just the specific bit of information needed, which can be read by other organelles.

The outside of the nucleus is known as the nuclear membrane. Along with the cell membrane, it is a lipid bilayer, and is responsible for protecting the inside of the nucleus. The nuclear membrane also contains many holes on the outside called pores, which allow material to enter and exit the nucleus.

The inside of the nucleus contains chromatin, squiggly strands of uncoiled DNA in the nucleus with associated proteins. Chromatin is what chromosomes are formed of, which dictate our whole body’s appearance.

In the center of the nucleus is the nucleolus. Nucleoli are small spherical structures responsible for creating ribosomes.
