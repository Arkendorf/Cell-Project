Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum is an internal membrane system where lipids, like fatty acids, and proteins are assembled, for transportation within or out of the cell.

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the synthesis of proteins. It gets its name from the ribosomes dotting its surface. The rough endoplasmic reticulum makes proteins that will be secreted from the cell as well as membrane proteins destined for specialized locations in the cell.
