Chloroplast

Chloroplasts are the biological equivalent to solar power plants. They capture the energy from sunlight and convert it into food and chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are only found In plant cells, and are what allow plants to live and make energy off of sunlight. However, plants can also have mitochondria, allowing them to live without sunlight for periods of time.

Chloroplasts contain little disks known as thylakoids, that are arranged in stacks. The chemical reactions and process of photosynthesis take place in the thylakoids, and their related systems.
