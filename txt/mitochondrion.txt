Mitochondrion

Mitochondria can be found in both plant and animal cells. The mitochondria are commonly known as “the power plants of the cell”, since they convert the chemical energy stored in food into compounds that are more convenient for the cell to use. They take in food and oxygen, and produce heat and energy, as well as waste products like carbon dioxide. Because they produce heat, cells with more mitochondria are hotter.

The inner part of a mitochondrion generates ATP, a chemical that is used throughout the body.
