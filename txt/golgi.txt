Golgi Apparatus

The golgi apparatus looks like a stack of flattened membranes. Its job is to modify, sort , and package proteins and other materials from the endoplasmic reticulum for storage in the cell or for release outside the cell. The golgi apparatus puts finishing touches on proteins, and ships them out, much like a post office, or shipping center. Microtubules from golgi send vesicles, packages containing cell product, outside or across the cell.
