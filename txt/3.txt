Cell Wall

Plant cells have a strong supportive layer around the membrane known as the cell wall. The cell wall is more rigid than the cell membrane, allowing the wall to help maintain the cellâ€™s shape. The cell wall also acts as a barrier between the cell and the outside world, protecting it from harmful substances.
